# EE Sharif Bachelor Thesis Template
LaTeX template for Sharif's Electrical Engineering Bachelor Thesis. 

This template is built upon the Sharif PhD thesis template by Prof. Shaifitabar which can be found in http://www.parsilatex.com/. I have made extensive modification to Prof. Sharifitabar's template and it seems that it fulfills the conditions of our department for bachelor theses.


Note that the template should be processed by XeLaTeX. This template has been tested in Overleaf and my local computer and it seems to work well. This has been tested for TeXlive 2016. I strongly recommend using this version of TeXlive as the Xepersian package has several issues with the 2020 version. For example, see http://qa.parsilatex.com/35710/__xepersian_mathsdigitspec_primitive_font_char_if_exist.
