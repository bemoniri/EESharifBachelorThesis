# EE Sharif Bachelor Thesis Template
LaTeX template for Sharif's Electrical Engineering Bachelor Thesis. 

This template is built upon the Sharif PhD thesis template by Prof. Shaifitabar which can be found in http://www.parsilatex.com/. I have made extensive modification to Prof. Sharifitabar's template and it seems that it fulfill's the conditions of our department for bachelor theses.


This template has been tested in Overleaf and my local computer and it seems to work well. Note that the template should be processed by XeLaTeX.


Please share this repo if it is useful :)
